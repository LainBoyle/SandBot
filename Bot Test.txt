```  ``` //**Kaneshon Cabin** //A wooden cabin made from Red Pine, with mahogany flooring. There are two bunkbeds adjacent to each other with a table in the middle housing some recently potted carnations- as well as a bunkbed to the farthest wall. There are four chairs made also from mahogany, with plush white cushions on the seat. The bunkbeds all have the same sheets and blankets. The sheets are all white, except for the pillows which have a light grey color to them with a fluffy white throw next to it. There are two windows on either side of the entrance, the main door, and a simple fireplace to the farthest of the bed room living room, on the opposite wall from the entrance. //There's a bathroom that has a two sink area, with a large mirror spanning across the wall. There aren't any real commodities other than some travel sized soap and shampoo, tossed haphazardly in a basket next to some cheap white towels. Thankfully, the sink area is cut off from the shower and toilet by a door/wall, so anyone can come in and wash their hands without bothering whoever is currently showering or using the shitter. //`[ Note : The list below is not all that can be investigated but serves as a starting point for investigations. ]`//```  ```
